    <string name="sorry">This is just a proof of concept. There\'s no interface.\n\nTo filter Toasts, add files named &lt;package name&gt; (e.g &quot;com.egingell.untoaster&quot;) - this is the package name of the app that generates the Toast - to /sdcard/UnToaster with the text of the Toast you want to block. One per each line. Regex is ok. Check the Xposed log for the package name.) for the pachage name.</string>
